_"It's in da spec!"_

Core library for running executable specifications using DaSpec with JavaScript. 

# What is DaSpec?

DaSpec is an automation framework for [Executable Specifications](http://daspec.com/guides/executable_specifications.html) in Markdown. It can help you:

* Share information about planned features with non-technical stakeholders easily, and get actionable unambiguous feedback from them 
* Ensure and document shared understanding of the planned software, making the definition of done stronger and more objective
* Document software features and APIs in a way that is easy to understand and maintain, so you can reduce the bus factor of your team and onboard new team members easily
* Make any kind of automated tests readable to non-technical team members and stakeholders

DaSpec helps teams achieve those benefits by validating human-readable documents against a piece of software. This makes it easy to argue if the software really does what the document claims, and also quickly points out to places in your documentation that need to be updated. Because of that, DaSpec can support you in moving from  confidence-based to evidence-based acceptance testing, and creating a living documentation system to remove knowledge bottlenecks.

DaSpec's primary target are teams practising Behaviour Driven Development, Specification by Example, ATDD and generally running short, frequent delivery cycles with a heavy dependency on test automation. It can, however, be useful to anyone looking to reduce the cost of discovering outdated information in documentation and tests.
